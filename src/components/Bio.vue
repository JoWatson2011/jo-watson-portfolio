      I am a scientist turned software developer. My scientific background means I am curious,
      analytical and always pushing myself to learn new things, all of which feed into my work as a
      developer.
    </span>
    <br />
    I have recently completed the Northcoders software development bootcamp and I am now actively
    looking for my first role in tech. I have built front- and back-end projects using a range of
    JavaScript frameworks and bring a strong background in data handling (including databases),
    analysis and visualisation.
