# Portfolio
## [www.jo-watson.co.uk](https://www.jo-watson.co.uk)
A place to present my work, built with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## Developer log
Before starting, I designed a simple mock-up of the website in figma. I was inspired by some great portfolio websites I found online, including [https://dunks1980.com](https://dunks1980.com), [https://droxey.com](https://droxey.com/) and [https://bonhomme.lol](https://bonhomme.lol) - I loved how each of these portfolios showed personality and presented the information concisely and clearly.

I tested the accessibility of the site using WAVE and Lighthouse. I designed it to be responsive to screen size and in the future would like to incorporate a light/dark mode. The buttons use css animations.
